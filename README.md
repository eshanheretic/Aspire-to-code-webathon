# Aspire-to-code-webathon
A simple project for progate's webathon which is intended to inspire new web developers.
It's a pretty simple project. I have used  CSS ,HTML and Javascript in order to create a simple website. The website consists of a homepage , a signup form , a blog related to web development and a photo blog.
